## :wave: Hi there! My name is Noelle Robertson. Welcome to my GitHub Page.

I am a technology coordinator for a school district researching cybersecurity solutions/efficiency for the K12 sector, particularly those with low technology/cybersecurity budgets.

## 🔍 Current Research
- 🧰 Building open source tools for K12 Tech Coordinators on a budget.
- 🚪 Investigate proxy detection on a network, build accessible monitoring tool.
- 💻 Study Software/AI Engineering at WGU to establish knowledge in software/tool development. 

## 🛰️ What I Do For Fun
- 🌲 Get out in nature.
- 📖 Read (non-fiction mostly... my favorite book is "The Order of Time" by Carlo Rovelli). 
- 📡 Study HAM Radio & Play around with SDR (working on getting my first license... eventually!).
- 🎨 Make weird art.
